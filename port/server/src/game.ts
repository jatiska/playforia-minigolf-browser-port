 *   - When THIS player finishes (holes-in or forfeits), they get a personal
 *     `game end` so the share dialog can appear; the room continues for others.
 *   - On `back`, the player is sent straight to `lobbyselect` (no daily lobby
 *     panel exists on the client).
 *   - On a date roll-over, the track is swapped and per-player counters reset
 *     so today's players see today's track.
