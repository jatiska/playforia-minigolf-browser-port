// Frozen bounds for the autoresearch loop. Tighter than the user-facing
// BOUNDS in config.ts.
//
// These bounds exist (per AUTORESEARCH_PLAN.md §2 "frozen") to close
// gaming vectors structurally rather than via prose hints in program.md.
// Concretely:
//
//   - safetyRetries up to ~12 (the user-facing slider goes to 50). At 50
//     the policy doesn't really learn - the rejection-sample loop just
//     tries 50 times per stroke. That inflates success rate without the
//     policy improving. Cap forces the loop to make the policy do the work.
//
//   - numParallel up to 8 (slider goes to 16). program.md flags this as
//     "slow and not load-bearing"; we enforce it here.
//
//   - searchHIOFirst is allowed (0/1) but the harness records hioWon
//     per map. The score still counts HIO wins (the policy *did* hole
//     in 1, even if it was via brute force) - this is intentional. The
//     hioWon flag exists for the human to spot "every win is HIO" and
//     decide whether to widen the eval map set.
//
// The eval harness applies these bounds via `clampToAutoresearchBounds`
// before training. If the program's exported config sets a knob outside
// the bound, it gets silently clamped - we deliberately don't error
// because the loop should be able to "try" any config and have the
// system reject it gracefully.
//
// This file is part of the FROZEN surface. The autoresearch loop must
// NEVER edit it. Doing so would re-open the gaming vectors.
